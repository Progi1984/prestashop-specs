      <description>Specifications for Date of delivery module In 1.7, the dateofdelivery module has never been integrated with Classic Theme, which results in the module not being displayed in front-office (when using the $hookDisplayBeforeCarrier). This specification aims at redefining available features with this module so that it is easier to make it work on PrestaShop 1.7.
FRONT-OFFICE This module displays an approximate date of delivery during the checkout process. It should be displayed in the &amp;ldquo;Shipping&amp;rdquo; section of the process, as shown on the mock up below.</description>

      <description>ps_facetedsearch specifications The faceted navigation displays a block with different criteria available to filter the products, mostly attributes, features, and price ranges. It is very handy to help the customers easily find a product.
This module has been massively reworked and keeps evolving frequently. This master issue (EPIC) allows to track the status of the module and follow its improvements : https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/9684
